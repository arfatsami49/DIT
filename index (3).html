    <h1> MOST POPULAR SEARCH ENGINES</h1>
    <p><strong>BING:</strong>Bing(before called Windows Live Search and MSN Search) is a search engine. Microsoft calls it a "decision engine",[3] meaning that Bing tries to interpret search queries and give people better search results compared to a typical search engine, helping the user make better decisions. Bing concentrates on four major areas: shopping, travel, local and health. A preview version was made available for everyone to use on June 1, 2009, and the website was fully launched on June 3, 2009.[4] The website quickly became popular after a few weeks.[5]

        On July 29, 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced that Bing would power Yahoo! Search.[6] All Yahoo! Search global customers and partners will be shifted to Bing by early 2012.[7]
        
        In October 2011, Microsoft announced "Tiger", a new internal search computer program for Bing. When it was finished, Bing delivered faster and more relevant search results for users. It has been incorporated into Bing since August 2011.[8]</p>
